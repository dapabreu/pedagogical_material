/************************************************************************************
* FILE: count.c
* Compile as : gcc count_solution.c -lpthread -D_REENTRANT -Wall -o count
* Or: gcc count_solution.c -pthread -Wall -o count
* DESCRIPTION:
*   NUM_WORKER_THREADS threads increase variable "count" a random number of times between 2 and 5
*   1 monitor thread watches the end of each worker thread
*   When all threads finish, the monitor thread prints the counter and leaves
*************************************************************************************/
// this solution adds a different mutex for the condition (before there was only one mutex to protect the change of count variable and to exit_threads condition
//  this way concurrency is improved
// the argument for the threads functions is also changed to int and pointers are changed (the result is the same)
